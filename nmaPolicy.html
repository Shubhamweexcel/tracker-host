    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Effective date: <strong>November 17, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>NMA Punjab (Nasha Mukti Abhiyan)</strong> ("the App"), an initiative of the <strong>Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare, Punjab</strong>, collects, uses, discloses, and protects personal information when you use our mobile application.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect information that is necessary to provide the services of the App and to fulfil the objectives of the Nasha Mukti Abhiyan.</p>

    <h3>1.1 Information you provide</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Profile &amp; contact details:</strong> Name, phone number, email (if you choose to provide).</li>
      <li><strong>Meeting documents &amp; media:</strong> Documents, photos, and videos you upload to the App for meeting reporting and documentation.</li>
      <li><strong>Messages &amp; feedback:</strong> Any messages, notes or feedback submitted via the App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2 Device &amp; usage data</h3>
    <p>We automatically collect certain information about your device and how you interact with the App, such as device model, operating system version, app version, usage statistics and crash reports. This data is used to improve the App and troubleshoot issues.</p>

    <h2>2. Permissions: Camera &amp; Gallery</h2>
    <p class="note"><strong>Why we request camera and gallery (storage) permissions:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Camera:</strong> To allow you to photograph meeting-related documents, attendance sheets, or other relevant materials and upload them directly from within the App.</li>
      <li><strong>Gallery / Storage access:</strong> To allow you to select and upload existing photos or documents from your device gallery or file storage.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These permissions are used only for uploading meeting documents and media. The App will prompt you for permission at the time the feature is required; you may decline or revoke permissions from your device settings at any time. If you decline, related features will not function.</p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To store and manage meeting documents and media uploaded by users.</li>
      <li>To generate reports and statistics for the Ministry and authorized program staff.</li>
      <li>To communicate important updates, instructions, or notifications related to the program.</li>
      <li>To improve the App’s functionality, security, and user experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Legal Basis &amp; Public Interest</h2>
    <p>The App operates as part of a public health initiative. Processing of personal data is carried out to support public health program delivery and monitoring. Where required by applicable law, we rely on consent for certain actions (for example, explicit consent to upload personal images) and otherwise on public interest or legitimate governmental functions to process program-related data.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing &amp; Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We may share the information you provide with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Authorized officers and staff of the Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare, Punjab, and other designated government agencies working on the NMA program.</li>
      <li>Third-party service providers who host the App, provide cloud storage or analytics — only to the extent necessary and under contract to protect your data.</li>
      <li>When required by law or to protect public health, safety, or rights (for example, responding to a lawful request by a government authority).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain personal data and uploaded documents only for as long as necessary to meet program goals, comply with legal obligations, and for auditing or reporting purposes. Retention periods may vary depending on the type of data; if you would like specifics, contact us using the details below.</p>

    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect your information. These include access controls, encrypted transmission (HTTPS), and secure cloud storage. However, no system is completely secure — if you have concerns about the security of your data, please contact us.</p>

    <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on local law, you may have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Access the personal information we hold about you.</li>
      <li>Request correction of inaccurate information.</li>
      <li>Request deletion of personal data where lawful and appropriate.</li>
      <li>Withdraw consent where processing is based on consent.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise any of these rights, contact us using the details below. We will respond in accordance with applicable laws and internal policies.</p>

    <h2>9. Children</h2>
    <p>The App is intended for use by program staff and adult users. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 18. If you believe we have collected information from a child in error, please contact us so we can promptly delete that information.</p>

    <h2>10. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App may use third-party services (for hosting, analytics, crash reporting). These providers may collect and process data on our behalf. We require them to maintain adequate security and to process data only as directed.</p>

    <h2>11. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>If personal information is transferred outside India (for example to cloud providers), we will ensure appropriate safeguards are in place as required by applicable law.</p>

    <h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the App or legal requirements. We will post the updated policy within the App and indicate the effective date. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
